# ATTACK_IN_SPACE
ATTACK_IN_SPACE was one of my first personal projects during high school, where I experimented with game development using Python and the Pygame library. My goal was to create a 2D space shooter while learning the fundamentals of game mechanics, physics, and rendering graphics.

## Through research and hands-on coding, I explored:
### ðŸŽ® Game loops & event handling
### ðŸ–¥ Sprite movement & collision detection
### ðŸ”Š Basic sound effects & animations

This project was a great learning experience that strengthened my problem-solving skills and fueled my passion for software development & game design.
